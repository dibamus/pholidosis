#' graph_edit_distance
#'
#' Graph edit distance, number of topological changes between two planar
#' networks with mostly homologous vertices. This does not measure differences
#' in vertex or edge attributes (i.e., edge weight differences).
#'
#' This function takes two graphs and measures edit distance between them,
#' returning
#' @import stringr tidyverse igraph
#' @param g1 An igraph object; the first graph.
#' @param g2 An igraph object; the second graph.
#' @param verbose logical; whether to print a data frame of matching cycles, helpful for debugging
#' @return A list containing
#'    1) g1.df - A data frame of topological changes to g1 and how they were resolved
#'    2) g2.df - A data frame of topological changes to g2 and how they were resolved
#'    3) distances - a list containing
#'        node - the number of un-shared vertices between g1 and g2
#'        swap - the number of "edge swaps" between g1 and g2
#'        edge - the number of non-"edge swap" unshared edges between g1 and g2
